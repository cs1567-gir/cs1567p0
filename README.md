===============

The project folder for Project 0.

This can be cloned directly into the <workspace>/src/ directory, to make updating the robot code much easier.

To simulate the robot in a 3d environment, install ros-hydro-kobuki-gazebo and ros-hydro-kobuki-gazebo-plugins.
Then use gazebo.launch instead of base.launch
